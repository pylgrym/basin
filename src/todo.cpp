/* this file is for todo notes. any stray thoughts that spring to mind.
 - carrying too much weight should trigger encumbrance, related to strength,
 and make e.g. weapon-attacks and defenses harder.
- heavy weapons should require more strength to handle well.

- obj type should switch from straight type to objdesc.(requires design.)

- money should have a purpose, necessary/useful things to buy, at e.g. town level,
so you get a cycle of hoarding heavy stuff, and selling it at town level,
and useful things to buy at town level.
consider alternate reality.

persistence.. start by  saving few things, e.g. stats.
I consider putting e.g. stats on labelled lines
 - i can ignore the label, but use it for verification.
