/* this file is for todo notes. any stray thoughts that spring to mind.

I made the potions prettier, so it's easier to feel the colours.
I picked a 'relevant' selection of colours, to have a practical set that stands
out, with 'poetic' names, like chartreuse.
Possibly I would go for shorter names, like tan.:-), for screen space.

thoughts: I already have guaranteed  stairs on every level
 - it could be cool to 'guarantee' some specific items, or specific selections,
 .e.g. 'there'll always be either a helm, a weapon, or a potion'
 (ie one of them, but you don't know which.)


partly DONE: - carrying too much weight should trigger encumbrance, related to strength,
 and make e.g. weapon-attacks and defenses harder.

- heavy weapons should require more strength to handle well.

- obj type should switch from straight type to objdesc.(requires design.)

- money should have a purpose, necessary/useful things to buy, at e.g. town level,
so you get a cycle of hoarding heavy stuff, and selling it at town level,
and useful things to buy at town level.
consider alternate reality.

persistence.. start by  saving few things, e.g. stats.
I consider putting e.g. stats on labelled lines
 - i can ignore the label, but use it for verification.
